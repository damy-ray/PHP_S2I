# PHP & MYSQL PROJECT - S2I

The project consists to create RESTful API for Orizon agency travel. 

- APIs must respect the REST architecture (in particular: naming, methods and response status codes);

- APIs must allow to insert, modify and delete a country, which has just one characteristic: the name; 

- APIs must allow to insert, modify and delete a journey, which has these characteristics: countries involved in that trip, number of seats available; 

- APIs have to show how many trips are entered, and they have to be filtered by countries and number of seats available; 

- MySQL has been used as database to store information;
